# The Farmer Was Replaced
My collection of drone scripts, experiments, and automation ideas for the game **The Farmer Was Replaced**.


## About the Game  
**The Farmer Was Replaced** is a simulation/automation game where you program a drone to manage a farm — planting, harvesting, watering, and upgrading technology.  
The in-game language is Python-like (but not full Python). You unlock more functions and resources as you progress.
